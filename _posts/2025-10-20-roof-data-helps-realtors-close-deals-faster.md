# For Realtors: How Roof Data Helps Close Deals Faster

### 🏡 The Roof — A Deal Maker or Breaker
Every experienced realtor knows that once the home inspection report lands, the roof can make or break the deal.  
A buyer’s uncertainty about roof condition often triggers **price reductions, repair requests, or second thoughts** — slowing or even killing the transaction.

But what if you could provide **clear, visual roof data upfront** before the home inspection ever begins?

That’s where **SkySure Inspections** steps in.

**Benefits for Realtors:**
- **Boost buyer confidence:** Show verified, high-quality roof visuals before inspection day.  
- **Preempt surprises:** Identify issues early so sellers can make repairs or price adjustments proactively.

### 🏠 Case Example: The Deal That Didn’t Stall
A local agent listed a 12-year-old home in Huntersville.  
Before listing, the seller ordered a **SkySure drone inspection**. The report showed only minor flashing wear — a $250 fix.  

The result?  
- The buyer saw the documented roof condition upfront.  
- The home went under contract in 4 days.  
- No re-negotiation after inspection.  

**Transparency builds trust — and trust closes deals.**
